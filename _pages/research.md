We use Keck/KCWI to perform the follow-up observation targeting on the famous protocluster MAMMOTH-1 discovered by [Cai et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02913) at $\rm z \approx 2.3$. This protocluster is surrounded by an enormous Ly$ \rm \alpha$ nebula with physical scale up to 440 kpc. By applying KCWI to this target, we find besides the Ly$$\rm \alpha$$  emission HeII and CIV emission also extend to byond 80 kpc. We obtain the flux-weighted velocity maps and dispersion maps from the three emissions and find they possess a velocity gradient at the same place with the same direction. In addition, dispersion map from the Ly$$\rm \alpha$$ emission reveals a region center on BOSS1441 (the center quasar of this protocluster) with FWHM > 1400 km/s and extends to 100 kpc.  This means this region possesses a violent turbulence. All of these evidences suggests an extremely powerful kinematic activity exists in this protocluster. We demonstrate that outflow from BOSS1441 is the most natural interpretation for this observation. By estimating the coupling efficiency and comparing with the simulation results of other works, we suggest only wind launched from the accretion disc of super massive black can power this outflow. This is AGN mode feedback and it is the first time to see its influence on CGM scale. This result will put strong constrain on the theoretical models and help us to further understand how galaxies coevolve with its gas environments.
