# Good day readers and welcome to my blog !

My name is Shiwu Zhang, A graduated student majoring in astronomy. I graduated from GuangXi University and I'm currently working in Department of Astronomy Tsinghua University, Beijing. 

My research is to study the coevolution of galaxies with its gas evironment, I use Keck/KCWI instrument to observe the famous protocluster discovered by [Cai et al 2017a](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02913). As a result, we find an extremely powerful outflow with strong HeII and CIV extended emissions up to 100 kpc. This outflow is likely to be powered by AGN mode feedback and it should be the first time to observe this sort of feedback influencing halo scale environment at high redshift. Besides, I'm also curious about cosmology and large scale structure of the universe. 

In free time (if it exists), I would like to watch movies, especially fictions, animated film and realistic movies. Here is the list I highly recommand:

* [<<Avatar>>](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/): A paraplegic Marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission becomes torn between following his orders and protecting the world he feels is his home.
* [<<Arrival>>](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164): A linguist works with the military to communicate with alien lifeforms after twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world.
* [<<Coherence>>](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/): In a personal party, a series strange things happended and everyone in the party lost in the parrallel universe.
*  [<<Interstellar>>](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/): A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in space in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival.
* [<<The Dark Knight>>](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/): When the menace known as the Joker wreaks havoc and chaos on the people of Gotham, Batman must accept one of the greatest psychological and physical tests of his ability to fight injustice. Best joker in my heart !!
* [<<The Martian>>](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/): An astronaut becomes stranded on Mars after his team assume him dead, and must rely on his ingenuity to find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.
* [<<Wondering Earth>>](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7605074/): s the sun is dying out, people all around the world build giant planet thrusters to move Earth out of its orbit and sail Earth to a new star system. Yet the 2500-year journey comes with unexpected dangers, and in order to save humanity, a group of young people in this age of a wandering Earth fight hard for the survival of humankind. The first real Chinese fictions !!! really proud of it !!

And Basketball is my favorite sports, I usually play shooting guard in games, I'm somehow good at cic and off the ball.  I' m a big fan of [Golden state warriors](https://www.nba.com/warriors/) and really want to watch live games. [Here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/15DMHYLVbbVJ6mHH228NaUw)'s some photos for my basketball games.
